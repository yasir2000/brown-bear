# Tuleap Core

Welcome to Tuleap Core, if you're looking for Clean Code, your princess is in another castle.

The purpose of this directory is to have a safe shore for code extracted from `src/www/` that should polluate `src/common/`.

It should be entry points / controllers / views & co. That is to say anything that should not be a "common" library.
