/**
 * This interface distinguish routes that are managed without Authorization or Authentication prior to routing.
 *
 * From the roots of Tuleap, there always been some level of authorization that was handled transparently for developer
 * - Access to platform (with or without login)
 * - Management of project access (restricted users & co)
 *
 * However this lead to cumbersome design with a central URL verification point (URLVerification objects) that sends
 * events to know in which project a resource is supposed to belong & so on.
 *
 * This interface is supposed to be implemented by Routes that need to manage permissions entirely on their own.
 * As a developer or review be very careful, you are alone here, no Black^WBrown magic is there to protect yourself.
