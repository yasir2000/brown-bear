<p>Most of the time you will allow the user to select a card among others.
    This is done by using the class <code class="code-inline">.tlp-card-selectable</code>.
</p>

<p>It is recommended to put the <code class="code-inline">.tlp-card</code> on a <code class="code-inline">&lt;a&gt;</code>
    element, so that end user can use the whole card as a regular link (open in new tab, copy link location, â€¦) which is
    not possible with a <code class="code-inline">&lt;div&gt;</code> element.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> HTML5 forbids nesting of <code class="code-inline">&lt;a&gt;</code> elements!</p>
