<p>By default there isn't margins on the main container; this allows you to be able to use
    the full with of the viewport (for example when you use <a href="#tabs">tabs</a>).<br>
    However most of the time you will need to add some margins (for example when you use
    <a href="#panes">panes</a>). This is achieving by using <code class="code-inline">.tlp-framed</code>.
