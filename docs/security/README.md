### Security Controls Framework
- **Preventive Controls**: Access controls, encryption, firewalls
- **Detective Controls**: Monitoring, logging, intrusion detection
- **Corrective Controls**: Incident response, patch management
- **Deterrent Controls**: Security awareness, audit trails
- **Compensating Controls**: Alternative security measures

## üîê Identity & Access Management

### Authentication Methods
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all privileged accounts
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens and OAuth 2.0
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: X.509 certificates for services

### Authorization Model
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permission assignment through roles
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Context-aware access decisions
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary elevated privileges
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum required permissions

## üîí Data Protection

### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key storage
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent data encryption (TDE)

### Data Classification
- **Public**: No restriction on disclosure
- **Internal**: Limited to organization members
- **Confidential**: Restricted access, business impact if disclosed
- **Restricted**: Highest classification, regulatory requirements

## üåê Network Security

### Network Segmentation
- **DMZ**: Public-facing services isolation
- **Internal Networks**: Application and database separation
- **Management Networks**: Administrative access isolation
