# 📝 Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Index

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during the development of the Brown Bear platform. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of architectural choices.

## 📚 **ADR Template**

See [ADR Template](./template.md) for the standard format for creating new ADRs.

## 📞 **ADR Governance**

### **👥 Decision Makers**
- **Chief Technology Officer**: Final authority on high-impact decisions
- **Lead Architects**: Primary decision makers for architectural choices
- **Engineering Leads**: Input on implementation feasibility
- **Security Team**: Review of security-related decisions

### **📋 Review Process**
1. **Preparation**: Author prepares ADR using template
2. **Technical Review**: Engineering team reviews for technical soundness
3. **Architecture Review**: Architecture team reviews for alignment
4. **Security Review**: Security team reviews security implications
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Business stakeholders review impact
6. **Final Approval**: CTO or designated authority approves
7. **Publication**: ADR is published and communicated

### **🔄 Maintenance**
