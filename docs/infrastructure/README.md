## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

### Core Services
- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Container orchestration platform
- **Database Systems**: MySQL for persistent data storage
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Load Balancers**: Traffic distribution and SSL termination
- **Container Registry**: Docker image storage and management

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and cloud-native monitoring
- **Logging System**: Centralized log aggregation and analysis
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage and rotation of sensitive data
- **Backup Systems**: Automated backup and recovery mechanisms
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment and infrastructure updates

## 🌐 Multi-Cloud Architecture

Brown Bear ALM supports deployment across multiple cloud providers:

- **AWS**: EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, ALB, Route53
- **Google Cloud**: GKE, Cloud SQL, Memorystore, Load Balancer
- **Azure**: AKS, Azure Database, Azure Cache, Application Gateway

## 📊 Infrastructure Diagrams

All infrastructure diagrams are created using Mermaid and embedded in the respective documentation files. These include:

- Network topology diagrams
- Service dependency graphs
- Data flow diagrams
- Deployment architecture
- Security zone layouts

## 🔧 Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is managed through:
- **Terraform**: Cloud resource provisioning
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Application deployment
- **Helm Charts**: Package management
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment workflows

## 📈 Performance & Scaling

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Automatic pod scaling based on metrics
- **Cluster Autoscaling**: Node scaling based on resource demands
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery optimization
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching implementation

## 🛡️ Infrastructure Security

- **Network Segmentation**: VPC isolation and security groups
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: RBAC and IAM policies
- **Secret Management**: Secure credential storage and rotation
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments
