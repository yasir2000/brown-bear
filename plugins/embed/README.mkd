Embed
=====

Purpose
-------

This plugin is here to provide enhanced capabilities on top of artifacts.

For example some designers may want to share their Figma mockup in a user story.
Usually they include the link to the Figma. This forces readers to leave the
context of the artifact.

Once activated, the current plugin will detect such url and will _embed_ the given
figma directly in the artifact for a direct preview.

Limitations
-----------

* 0nly artifacts are supported.
* Only Figma and Blackfire URLs are supported. Please get in touch with us to express your interest for other integrations.
