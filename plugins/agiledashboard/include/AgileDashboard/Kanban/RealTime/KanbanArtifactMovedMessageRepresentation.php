     * - We can't use a "compared_to" style because if we reorder item A
     * after an item H, we won't know where H is.
     * - We can't rely on rank either, because when an item is reordered,
     * many item's ranks may change. We would have to get the ranks of all
     * the kanban items for every drag'n'drop.
     * Therefore, we send all the ids of the destination column. The
     * kanban app places items that it knows about and ignores those the
     * user can't see.
