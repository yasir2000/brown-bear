# How to generate data for REST tests ?

To add data for REST tests, we import files generated with MySQL (the only way I found to add PhpWiki data ...)

To do this:

* Add the data you want in your PhpWiki instance
* Connect to your Tuleap MySQL server
* Get the project_id you want to extract data
* Execute :
    - SELECT * FROM wiki_group_list WHERE group_id = %PROJECT_ID% INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/rest-test-wiki-group-list';
    - SELECT id,pagename,hits,pagedata,cached_html,101 FROM wiki_page WHERE group_id = %PROJECT_ID% INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/rest-test-wiki-page';
    - SELECT * FROM wiki_nonempty WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM wiki_page WHERE group_id = %PROJECT_ID%) INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/rest-test-wiki-nonempty';
    - SELECT * FROM wiki_version WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM wiki_page WHERE group_id = %PROJECT_ID%) INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/rest-test-wiki-version';
    - SELECT * FROM wiki_recent WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM wiki_page WHERE group_id = %PROJECT_ID%) INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/rest-test-wiki-recent';
* Copy the generated files into Tuleap sources: `scp /tmp/rest-test-* /tuleap/tests/rest/_fixtures/phpwiki`
