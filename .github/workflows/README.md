REGISTRY_USERNAME
REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# Deployment (if deploying to external services)
STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY
PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY

# Monitoring (if using external monitoring)
MONITORING_API_KEY
```

### **Environment Variables**
The workflows use these environment variables:

```yaml
REGISTRY: ghcr.io                    # Container registry
IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }} # Container image name
NODE_VERSION: '18'                   # Node.js version
PNPM_VERSION: '8.15.0'              # pnpm version
PHP_VERSION: '8.0'                   # PHP version
```

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   # Creates PR → Triggers CI Pipeline
   ```

2. **Pull Request Review**
   - CI pipeline runs automatically
   - Security checks performed
   - Code quality validated
   - Tests executed with coverage

3. **Merge to Main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/new-feature
   # Triggers Release Pipeline
   ```

4. **Automated Release**
   - Semantic versioning applied
   - Changelog generated
   - Containers built and pushed
   - Staging deployment executed
   - Production deployment (on tags)

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Workflow Fails on Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and retry
   gh workflow run ci.yml
   ```

2. **Container Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check Dockerfile syntax
   docker build -t test .
   ```

3. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Run tests locally
   pnpm test
   pnpm lint
   ```

4. **Deployment Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check environment configuration
   # Verify secrets are configured
   # Review deployment logs
   ```

### **Debugging Commands**

```bash
# View workflow status
gh run list

# View specific workflow run
gh run view [run-id]

# Download logs
gh run download [run-id]

# Trigger manual workflow
gh workflow run [workflow-name]
```

## 📚 **Best Practices**

### **Commit Messages**
Use conventional commits for automated releases:
```bash
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login bug
docs: update API documentation
chore: update dependencies
```

### **Branch Protection**
Configure branch protection rules:
- Require status checks
- Require pull request reviews
- Restrict force pushes
- Require up-to-date branches

### **Security**
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor security alerts
- Review workflow permissions
- Use secrets for sensitive data
